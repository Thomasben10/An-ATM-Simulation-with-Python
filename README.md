# An-ATM-Simulation-with-Python
The ATM Simulation project is a practical and engaging exercise by creating  a simple ATM system. The system allows users to check their balance, deposit  money, and withdraw funds
This project introduces basic Object-Oriented Programming OOP concepts by encapsulating the ATM's logic within a class and handling user interactions through a controller class.
